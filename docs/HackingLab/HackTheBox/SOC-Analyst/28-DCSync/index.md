# DCSync

## Description

`DCSync` is an attack that threat agents utilize to **impersonate a Domain Controller** and **perform replication with a targeted Domain Controller** to `extract password hashes` from **Active Directory**. The attack can be performed both from the perspective of `a user account` or `a computer`, as long as they have the **necessary permissions assigned**, which are:

- `Replicating Directory Changes`
- `Replicating Directory Changes All`

---

## Attack

We will utilize the user `Rocky` (whose password is `Slavi123`) to showcase the `DCSync` attack. When we check the permissions for Rocky, we see that he has `Replicating Directory Changes` and `Replicating Directory Changes All` assigned:

![AD-Permissions-Rocky](img/AD-Permissions-Rocky.png)

First, we need to start a new command shell running as Rocky:

```cmd
C:\Users\bob\Downloads>runas /user:eagle\rocky cmd.exe

Enter the password for eagle\rocky:
Attempting to start cmd.exe as user "eagle\rocky" ...
```

![cmd-1](img/cmd-1.png)

Subsequently, we need to use `Mimikatz`, one of the tools with an implementation for performing `DCSync`. We can run it by specifying the username whose password hash we want to obtain if the attack is successful, in this case, the user `Administrator`:

It is possible to specify the `/all` parameter instead of a specific username, which will **dump the hashes of the entire AD environment**. We can perform `pass-the-hash` with the obtained hash and authenticate against any Domain Controller.

---

## Prevention

What `DCSync` abuses is **a common operation** in Active Directory environments, as `replications happen between Domain Controllers all the time`; therefore, **preventing** DCSync out of the box is not an option. The only prevention technique against this attack is using solutions such as the [RPC Firewall](https://github.com/zeronetworks/rpcfirewall), a third-party product that can `block` or `allow` **specific RPC calls with robust granularity**. For example, using `RPC Firewall`, we can **only allow replications from Domain Controllers**.

---

## Detection

Detecting `DCSync` is easy because **each Domain Controller replication generates** an [event with the ID 4662](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4662). We can pick up abnormal requests immediately by monitoring for this event ID and checking whether the initiator account is a Domain Controller. Here's the event generated from earlier when we ran `Mimikatz`; it serves as a flag that a user account is performing this replication attempt:

![4662](img/4662.png)

Since replications occur constantly, we can **avoid false positives** by ensuring the followings:

- Either the property `1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2` or `1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2` is [present in the event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/1522b774-6464-41a3-87a5-1e5633c3fbbb).

- `Whitelisting systems/accounts` with a (valid) business reason for replicating, such as `Azure AD Connect` *(this service constantly replicates Domain Controllers and sends the obtained password hashes to Azure AD)*.
